Three-pivot Quicksort Algorithm
-----------------------------------
The Three-pivot Quicksort algorithm [1] is a variation of the regular Quicksort algorithm, where instead of
the traditional single pointer with two sub-problems, the Three-pivot variation uses three pivots and partitions a
sequence into four sub-problems. The three-pivot Quicksort algorithm was introduced in [1], and observed that it is not significantly faster when compared to the regular
version of Quicksort. This study aims to observe the difference in run-time of Three-pivot and regular sorting algorithms when executed
on contemporary computing machines and discover possible optimization techniques that would enhance the run-time of the Three-pivot variation of the Quicksort algorithm.
